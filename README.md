# HSGCoding: Who is Who in Hollywood
This project allows the users to retreive results from a database. It is based on the assignment of Project 7.

## Getting started
To run the programm, you have **two options**:
1. Use the Graphical User Interface (GUI):  
In order to start the program with the GUI, run the class `gui_Project7`. A window will pop up with which  you can user the program.
2. Use the terminal:  
In oder to start the program with the terminal, run the class `terminal_Project7`. You will receive clear instructions for the next stepts in the terminal

We, the developers, clearly recommend using the GUI.

## Funtionality
The programm works like an Internet Moive Database and can respond to queries from the user. It has two modi:
1. Enter two movies and receive all actors that either play in both movies (&), played at least in one of the movies (|), or played in exactly one of the two movies (^)
2. Enter the name of an actor and receive all co-actors, the actor ever played with in a movie


## Installation
If the TK Package, which is required for the GUI, is not installed by default, the following steps can be done to set it up (for MacOS):
1) Install brew: `$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
2) Install Tkinter using brew: `brew install python-tk`
